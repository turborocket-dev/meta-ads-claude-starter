# Verify Meta API tier post-approval.
#
# Why this exists:
#   The /api/quota endpoint reads from the in-memory rate_limiter cache.
#   That cache is empty until at least 1 real Marketing API call has
#   been made — so right after approval, /api/quota will still report
#   "development_access" with max 60 pts, even though the upgrade is
#   already active. This script triggers a real read first, then queries
#   the quota, so you see the actual current tier.
#
# Usage:
#   ./verify-tier.sh <account_id> <api_base_url>
#
# Example:
#   ./verify-tier.sh act_XXXXXXXXXX https://your-domain.com
